Project Title: Object Detection System

Internship: CodeClause Internship (AI Domain)


* Description:
This project detects and classifies real-time objects using a webcam. It uses the YOLOv8 model integrated with OpenCV to process video frames and draw bounding boxes around detected objects.


* Technologies Used:
Python, YOLOv8 (Ultralytics), OpenCV


* How to Run:
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install ultralytics opencv-python

2. Run the project:
   python object_detection.py



* What I Learned:
- How to use pre-trained models for real-time object detection
- How to work with webcam input using OpenCV
- Basics of YOLOv8 integration and usage
